# Mining

>Peercoin uses both the Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake algorithms. The PoW algorithm is used to spread the distribution of new coins. Up to 99% of all peercoins is created with PoW. Proof-of-Stake is used to secure the network: The chain with longest PoS coin age wins in case of a blockchain split-up.

Peercoin uses the hashcash double iterated SHA-256 algorithm for [Proof-of-Work mining](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work). This means anything that any hardware that can mine Bitcoin can mine Peercoin as well.

To mine Peercoin, you need a mining software. Below is a list that is not official endorsed but have been found to have a decent reputation.

* [BFGMiner](http://bfgminer.org/)
* [CGMiner](https://github.com/ckolivas/cgminer)
* [EasyMiner](https://easyminer.net/)

There are others, but this list can be used as a starting place.  Each will request pool or solo information and should come with the related support.
