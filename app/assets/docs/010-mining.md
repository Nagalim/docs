# Mining

Since Peercoin is a fork of Bitcoin, is uses the same SHA-256 encryption and protocol for mining.  This means anything that any hardware that can mine BTC can mine Peercoin as well.  For the majority of people, joining a mining pool will bring the highest profit versus solo mining.

To mine Peercoin, you need a mining software.  Below is a list that is not official endorsed but have been found to have a decent reputation.

There are others, but this list can be used as a starting place.  Each will request pool or solo information and should come with the related support.
