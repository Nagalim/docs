# Introduction to Peercoin

Hello, and welcome to the Peercoin Documentation website. We hope to help you understand more about this coin, its philosopy and technologies that runs behind it. Before getting too technical, we invite you to dive a little bit into the history of Peercoin, leraning why it was created, and the purposes behind it.

## Peercoin Genesis: 2012

Since the creation of Bitcoin (Nakamoto 2008), proof-of-work has been the predominant design of peer-to-peer crypto currency. The concept of proof-of-work has been the backbone of minting and security model of Nakamotoâ€™s design.

# Comparison with other blockchain networks

Peercoin is best compared with its sibling - Bitcoin; however in the following table we'll show how it bodes against something vastly different like Ethereum. Peercoin was invented as response to increasing doubts on Bitcoin's PoW consensus model with regards to its increasing centralization and conflict of interests between miners. Peercoin can be understood as a Proof-of-Stake clone of Bitcoin, though that is an oversimplification as Peercoin differs vastly - especially when it comes to economics and incentives of the system.
Major differences between the two are the fee market, ie. the absence of it in Peercoin and Peercoin's dedication to continual token distribution via PoW block rewards while the Bitcoin's distribution rate (also PoW block rewards) is reduced geometrically every four years until it becomes zero.


### Consensus algorithm

### Distribution

Peercoin is continually distributed via PoW block rewards. At the time of writing there is 24,828,480.19 PPC issued with annual inflation of 2.3%.
The `MAX_MONEY` variable in the Peercoin source code is nothing but a placeholder.
There is no final number of Peercoins issued, while inflation is steadily diverging toward fixed 1%.
Peercoin PoW block reward is product of network Proof-of-Work hashrate. The higher the network hashrate, the lower the block reward.
This mechanism effectively pegging the issuance of Peercoins to the development of SHA256 asic miners. Reasoning behind this decision is that it's expected that development of SHA256 miners represent the level of advancement of general cryptocurrency scene, at least that is something that is visible to the blockchain and can be encode in algorithm.

Proof-of-Work reward formula is:  `difficulty == (9999 / (mint per block)) ** 4`

Proof-of-Work coin mint rate is a function of difficulty, for every 16x in difficulty mint rate is halved.


### Fee market

The fee market provides a mechanism to decide which transactions have priority over the others. Transaction fees are claimed by the block miner in both Bitcoin and Ethereum economic systems. This provides the miners with an incentive to include transactions in the blocks they mine. If Alice wants her transaction to be included in the next block, she should set transaction fee higher and pay more then other network users, ie. outbid them. It is presumed that miners, as rational subjects, will first include transactions which carry the most Bitcoin value. If Alice pays a transaction fee which is under the average fee at the time she might wait for several blocks (or hundreds of blocks) to see her transaction included and confirmed. So, it is obvious that the fee market serves as the incentive for miners to process and include the transactions in the blocks they mine.
With Bitcoin's block size limit set to 1MB there exists an artificial upward pressure on the price of transaction fees - incentivizing miners to validate the transactions. This is especially important as Bitcoin's economy is expected to run on transaction fees alone when the block subsidies eventually stop.

Peercoin's fees are fixed at 0.01 PPC per kb and are burned. This is equivalent to paying the transaction fee to each Peercoin holder in proportion to their Peercoin holdings since the fee decreases the total supply of Peercoins. This property eliminates the need for a fee market on Peercoin's network and allows every transaction to get included in the very next block. Peercoin retains the 1MB block size limit as it is based on the Bitcoin code, but it has no intricate need to keep it. The block size limit will definitely be increased as Peercoin's network grows in usage. Peercoin developers have already hinted that Peercoin will feature a dynamic block size in the near future.
Due to these economic properties of Peercoin a question arises: Why do Peercoin miners bother processing the transactions?

From a spectator looking at this from a Bitcoin oriented perspective the answer is that Peercoin block miners want to process transactions so they allow Peercoins to be burned - thus making their own stake in the network more valuable.
However when the intricacies of PoS are learned it is understood that with Peercoin minters (PoS miners) include transactions because it doesn't cost much to include them, while producing empty blocks reduces the value of the blockchain, and therefore of their stake. The burned fees are not really an argument as the effect on their holdings is negligible.
Bitcoin miners always start off mining an empty block, otherwise they lose the time it takes to validate the transactions and signatures, as time is money on the Bitcoin network. Only after they have validated the txns to include and have computed the merkle root, they start mining blocks with txns.
While for PoS, the time advantage is negligible as you can still use the stake hash of a few seconds ago. (hrobeers, 30.08.2017)


### Block size limit and block time spacing

Bitcoin features the 1MB block size limits which serves to place the upward pressure on the transaction fee price, Peercoin copies this parameter from the Bitcoin but it's economic model does not depend on scarcity of the block space.
Bitcoin and Peercoin generate a block every 10 minutes while Ethereum generates a block every 12 seconds. Considering this and the block size limit of 1MB, Bitcoin and Peercoin have a transaction per second (TPS) of about seven tps and Ethereum of about 25 tps.

# Compiling packages for Debian and Ubuntu

As Peercoin is made to run on range of platforms, from Amazon's server to low powered Raspberry Pi Debian is perfect OS platform for deploying Peercoin nodes as it is renowned for multitude of supported hardware architectures as well as security and stability.

For compilation of Debian packages we will be using `pbuilder` which is a automatic Debian Package Building system for personal development workstation environments.<sup>[3.1](#footnote-3.1)</sup> pbuilder aims to be an easy-to-setup system for auto-building Debian packages inside a clean-room environment, so that it is possible to verify that a package can be built on most Debian installations. The clean-room environment is achieved through the use of a base chroot image, so that only minimal packages will be installed inside the chroot.

The following tutorial is written for the Ubuntu or Debian host, precisely Ubuntu 17.10 which is last stable version of Ubuntu at the time of writing.

## Prepare the tooling

`sudo apt install pbuilder qemu-user-static ubuntu-keyring debian-archive-keyring`

We'll also need keyring for the Raspbian, which a Debian fork made for the Raspberry Pi platform, so we can compile packages for this ARM based mini-pc platform.

> wget http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/pool/main/r/raspbian-archive-keyring/raspbian-archive-keyring_20120528.2_all.deb

> sudo dpkg -i raspbian-archive-keyring_20120528.2_all.deb

Now, set up the conf file for the pbuilder.

`touch .pbuilderrc`

> gedit .pbuilderrc

Paste the following:

```
#!/bin/sh

set -e

PBUILDERSATISFYDEPENDSCMD="/usr/lib/pbuilder/pbuilder-satisfydepends-apt"

if [ "$OS" == "debian" ]; then
    MIRRORSITE="http://ftp.no.debian.org/debian/"
    COMPONENTS="main contrib non-free"
    DEBOOTSTRAPOPTS=("${DEBOOTSTRAPOPTS[@]}"
        "--keyring=/usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg")
    : ${DIST:="wheezy"}
    : ${ARCH:="amd64"}
    if [ "$DIST" == "wheezy" ]; then
        #EXTRAPACKAGES="$EXTRAPACKAGES debian-backports-keyring"
        OTHERMIRROR="$OTHERMIRROR | deb $MIRRORSITE wheezy-backports $COMPONENTS"
    fi
elif [ "$OS" == "raspbian" ]; then
    MIRRORSITE="http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/raspbian/raspbian/"
    COMPONENTS="main contrib non-free"
    DEBOOTSTRAPOPTS=("${DEBOOTSTRAPOPTS[@]}"
        "--keyring=/usr/share/keyrings/raspbian-archive-keyring.gpg")
    : ${DIST:="wheezy"}
    : ${ARCH:="armhf"}
elif [ "$OS" == "ubuntu" ]; then
    MIRRORSITE="http://no.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/"
    COMPONENTS="main restricted universe multiverse"
    DEBOOTSTRAPOPTS=("${DEBOOTSTRAPOPTS[@]}"
        "--keyring=/usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg")
else
    echo "Unknown OS: $OS"
    exit 1
fi

if [ "$DIST" == "" ]; then
    echo "DIST is not set"
    exit 1
fi

if [ "$ARCH" == "" ]; then
    echo "ARCH is not set"
    exit 1
fi

NAME="$OS-$DIST-$ARCH"

if [ "$ARCH" == "armel" ] && [ "$(dpkg --print-architecture)" != "armel" ]; then
    DEBOOTSTRAP="qemu-debootstrap"
fi
if [ "$ARCH" == "armhf" ] && [ "$(dpkg --print-architecture)" != "armhf" ]; then
    DEBOOTSTRAP="qemu-debootstrap"
fi

DEBOOTSTRAPOPTS=("${DEBOOTSTRAPOPTS[@]}" "--arch=$ARCH")
BASETGZ="/var/cache/pbuilder/$NAME-base.tgz"
DISTRIBUTION="$DIST"
BUILDRESULT="$HOME/pbuild-results/"
APTCACHE="/var/cache/pbuilder/$NAME/aptcache/"
BUILDPLACE="/var/cache/pbuilder/build"
HOOKDIR="/var/cache/pbuilder/hook.d/"
```

Make the directory where pbuilder will place the packages:

`mkdir -p $HOME/pbuild-results`

### Bootstrap the chroots

Raspbian:

> sudo OS=raspbian DIST=stretch ARCH=armhf pbuilder --create

Debian stable:

> sudo OS=debian DIST=stretch ARCH=amd64 pbuilder --create

## Preparing for build

(compiling for Raspbian stretch in this example)

Download the latest .tar.gz from github.com/peercoin.

> wget https://github.com/peercoin/peercoin/archive/v0.6.3ppc.rc1.tar.gz

Debian build system is very strict about names, so we need to rename this to:

`peercoin_0.6.3.orig.tar.gz`

Extract the contests of the file using `tar xf` and `cd` to it.

Copy the debian directory from the contrib to this directory:

`cp -r contrib/debian .`

### Some modifications

(this is just an extra step required for the Raspbian, to fix problem with autotools)

`sed '/./configure --with-gui=qt5 --with-incompatible-bdb/s/$/ --with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/' debian/rules`

## Building the package

`OS=raspbian DIST=stretch ARCH=armhf pdebuild`

And wait, it will take a while so go get a coffee or something. It's compiling by emulating ARM cpu in QEMU.

The concept of pbuild and cross-platform compilations is that you pass it this environment variables like "OS" and "DIST".

For example OS=debian and DIST=wheezy will use Debian Wheezy chroot, you can also pick architecture by using ARCH= environment variable.
